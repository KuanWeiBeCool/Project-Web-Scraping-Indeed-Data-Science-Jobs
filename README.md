# Project-Web-Scraping-Indeed-Data-Science-Jobs
Data Scientists and statisticians have recently become one of the most fast growing jobs in the last couple of years, due to the increasing value in utilizing big data. Many different companies across various of fields are seeking for data scientists in the job market. Out of curiosity, I want to know what are the most important skills that companies are looking for as data scientists. In this project, I created my own web scrapper and scraped the qualification information from 105 data scientist related job posts near Toronto, ON, Canada on Indeed.com.
